Problem Statement 
The most common problem faced by college students is procrastination. This is often at its core cause by a lack of awareness of time remaining for an assignment in comparison to the length of time it will take to complete this assignment. The pomodoro is a documented process for completing work that has been shown to be effective, however there is yet to be an implementation of pomodoro that implements planning in a cohesive way. 
Motivation
My two biggest struggles with completing projects or assignments are time management and dealing with the frustration that comes along trying to get as many points possible. It is well known that the usage of a planner or to-do list is very effective in the reduction of work overload and focus. It is very easy to be overwhelmed by work because as humans we deal with a variety of stressors throughout our day-to-day lives. A planner/to-do list gives an individual at a glance, the ability to have a clear and simple vision of all the things they have to do. While simple on the surface, a list forces you to have a system
Conclusion
In the end I was unable to implement all of the features that I wanted to. From all the feature mentioned in this proposal, I was only able to implement a GUI planner.
